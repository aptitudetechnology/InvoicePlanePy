# InvoicePlanePy Python Code Audit Report

This report summarizes opportunities to improve the InvoicePlanePy codebase using modern Python libraries, following the guidelines in `improve-code-with-python-libs.md`.

---

## 1. Data Processing & Manipulation
- **Current:** No evidence of Pandas/Polars for data manipulation; custom logic likely used for filtering, sorting, and transformations.
- **Recommendation:** Use Pandas for complex data operations, CSV/Excel handling, and reporting. Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
- **Benefits:** Cleaner code, better performance, easier maintenance.

## 2. File System Operations
- **Current:** No `os.path` usage found in app code, but check scripts for manual file handling.
- **Recommendation:** Use `pathlib` for all path manipulations and file checks. Use `shutil` for advanced file operations.
- **Benefits:** Cross-platform compatibility, improved readability.

## 3. HTTP Requests & API Interactions
- **Current:** No `requests` or `urllib` usage found in app code.
- **Recommendation:** Use `requests` or `httpx` for HTTP client needs. Use `aiohttp` for async HTTP.
- **Benefits:** Simpler, more robust HTTP handling.

## 4. Database Operations (PostgreSQL)
- **Current:** Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for models and database access. Some async FastAPI routes, but check for blocking DB calls.
- **Recommendation:** Use SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM or `databases` for async DB operations. Use Alembic for migrations. Avoid raw SQL string concatenation.
- **Benefits:** Performance, security, maintainability.

## 5. Configuration Management
- **Current:** Uses `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` in `app/config.py`.
- **Recommendation:** Continue using Pydantic Settings. Consider `python-dotenv` for `.env` loading if not already used.
- **Benefits:** Type safety, environment flexibility.

## 6. FastAPI Interface
- **Current:** Uses Pydantic models, dependency injection, async routes, and background tasks.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure all request/response validation uses Pydantic. Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks for long-running jobs. Use dependency injection for DB/auth.
- **Benefits:** Robust API, maintainable code, clear OpenAPI docs.

## 7. CLI Interface
- **Current:** No evidence of Typer/Click; check scripts for argparse or manual CLI parsing.
- **Recommendation:** Use Typer for new CLI tools for better UX and maintainability. Use Rich for output.
- **Benefits:** Modern CLI, better help, easier testing.

## 8. Reports & Data Export
- **Current:** No Pandas/Plotly/OpenPyXL/WeasyPrint detected for reporting or export.
- **Recommendation:** Use Pandas for aggregation, Plotly for charts, OpenPyXL for Excel, WeasyPrint for PDF.
- **Benefits:** Professional, flexible reporting and export.

## 9. Error Handling & Logging
- **Current:** No Loguru or Sentry detected; likely uses standard logging.
- **Recommendation:** Use Loguru for logging, Sentry for error tracking, Rich for error formatting.
- **Benefits:** Better error visibility, easier debugging.

## 10. Date/Time Handling
- **Current:** Uses `datetime` and `timedelta` in several modules.
- **Recommendation:** Use Arrow or Pendulum for advanced date/time logic.
- **Benefits:** Simpler, more robust date/time code.

---

## Priority Recommendations
- **High:** Security (SQL injection, input validation), async DB, error-prone custom code.
- **Medium:** Code readability, maintenance, developer experience.
- **Low:** Style, minor optimizations.

- [ ] Dependencies are actively maintained libraries
- [ ] Changes don't introduce unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Migration path is clear and documented
- [ ] Testing strategy is considered for each change
- [ ] Performance implications are evaluated

## Template Modernization Opportunities (from Legacy PHP to Python)

### 1. Templating Engine
- **Current (PHP):** Inline PHP with `echo`, logic, and conditionals.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use Jinja2 for separation of logic and presentation, template inheritance, and maintainability.

### 2. HTML Escaping & Formatting
- **Current (PHP):** Custom escaping and formatting functions.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use Jinja2's auto-escaping and custom filters for currency, percentage, etc.

### 3. Internationalization (i18n)
- **Current (PHP):** `_trans()` for translations.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use Babel or gettext with Jinja2 for translations and locale-aware formatting.

### 4. Currency, Date, Number Formatting
- **Current (PHP):** Manual formatting functions.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use Babel for `format_currency`, `format_date`, etc.

### 5. Document Structure and Reusability
- **Current (PHP):** Large files with repeated layout blocks.
- **Recommended (Python):** Jinja2 template inheritance, shared partials, and modular templates.

### 6. Static Assets & CSS
- **Current (PHP):** Dynamic style loading via PHP.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use Flask/FastAPI static file serving and organized static folder structure.

### 7. Conditional Logic
- **Current (PHP):** Mixed inline logic and rendering.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use clean Jinja2 conditionals and loops.

### 8. Custom Fields & Metadata
- **Current (PHP):** Access via associative arrays.
- **Recommended (Python):** Pass structured data to templates and access via Jinja2.

### 9. Template Testing
- **Current (PHP):** Difficult to test rendered output.
- **Recommended (Python):** Use pytest + Jinja2 for template tests and pytest-regressions for snapshot testing.

**These improvements will make templates more maintainable, testable, and Pythonic.**
