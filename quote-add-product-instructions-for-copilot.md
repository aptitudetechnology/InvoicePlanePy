Changes Needed:

Add the Product Modal HTML - Your original template doesn't have the modal structure for product selection
Implement Product Loading - Need to add the loadProducts() function to fetch from /products/api
Replace the Placeholder Function - The current addProduct() function just logs to console
Add Product Selection Logic - Need selectProduct() and filterProducts() functions
Add Product Variable - Need to declare let products = [];
Update Page Initialization - Need to call loadProducts() on page load

What's Missing in Your Original Code:

The entire product selection modal (about 20 lines of HTML)
About 80 lines of JavaScript for product functionality
Integration between product selection and quote item addition

If You Want the Feature:
You'll need to implement these changes to connect your existing products API to the quote editing interface.
