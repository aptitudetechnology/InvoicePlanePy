# Fixing the Tax Rates Bulk Save Endpoint (404 Not Found)

## Problem

Your FastAPI app includes the `tax_rates` router with this line:

```python
app.include_router(tax_rates.router, prefix="/settings/tax_rates", tags=["tax_rates"])
```

This means all routes in `app/routers/tax_rates.py` are prefixed with `/settings/tax_rates`.

If your router defines a route like:
```python
@router.post("/tax_rates/api/save")
```

The full path becomes:
```
/settings/tax_rates/tax_rates/api/save
```

So, a POST to `/tax_rates/api/save` will return 404 Not Found.

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Your Frontend JavaScript

Change your fetch URL to:

```javascript
fetch('/settings/tax_rates/tax_rates/api/save', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ tax_rates: taxRates })
})
```

### Option 2: Change the Router Prefix (Recommended for Simpler URLs)

In `app/main.py`, change:
```python
app.include_router(tax_rates.router, prefix="/settings/tax_rates", tags=["tax_rates"])
```
to:
```python
app.include_router(tax_rates.router, prefix="/tax_rates", tags=["tax_rates"])
```

Now, your endpoint will be available at:
```
/tax_rates/api/save
```

And your frontend can use:
```javascript
fetch('/tax_rates/api/save', { ... })
```

## Summary
- The 404 is due to a double prefix in your route.
- Either update your frontend to match the full path, or change the router prefix for cleaner URLs.
- Option 2 is recommended for clarity and maintainability.
