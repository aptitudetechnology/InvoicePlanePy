I can see your edit.html template. You've made good progress transitioning away from inline event handlers - I notice you're now using `data-action` attributes instead of `onclick` handlers, which is much cleaner.

Looking at both files, I can see a few areas where the JavaScript and template need to be aligned:

1. **Event handler selectors**: Your JavaScript is still looking for `onclick` attributes in some places, but your template now uses `data-action` attributes.

2. **Item counter initialization**: You're setting `itemCounter` in a script tag, but your QuoteManager class also initializes its own counter by counting existing rows.

3. **Data attributes**: Your template uses `data-calculate` attributes that could be leveraged for event delegation.

4. **Hidden product_id field**: Your JavaScript creates this field in `addNewRow()`, but I don't see it in the existing item template rows.

The structure looks good overall - you have a clean separation between the template and the JavaScript logic. The QuoteManager class should work well with this template structure.

What specific issues are you encountering, or what would you like me to help you with regarding the integration between these two files?
