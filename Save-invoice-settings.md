# Plan to Persist Invoice Settings in InvoicePlanePy

## 1. Files to Edit

- `app/routers/settings.py` (add database save logic to the POST handler for invoice settings)
- `app/models/invoicesettings.py` (ensure model matches schema and supports updates)
- `app/templates/settings/invoice.html` (optional: update success message after persistence)

## 2. Steps and Code Required

### Step 1: Update the POST Route in `settings.py`

Replace the placeholder logic in the POST `/invoices` handler with code to save/update settings in the database:

```python
from app.models.invoicesettings import InvoiceSettings

@router.post("/invoices", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def save_invoice_settings(
    request: Request,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    default_invoice_group: str = Form(None),
    default_payment_method: str = Form(None),
    default_terms: str = Form(None),
    invoices_due_after: int = Form(None),
    generate_invoice_number_draft: str = Form(None),
    mark_invoices_sent_pdf: str = Form(None),
    enable_pdf_watermarks: str = Form(None),
    invoice_pdf_password: str = Form(None),
    include_zugferd: str = Form(None),
    default_pdf_template: str = Form(None)
):
    settings = {
        "default_invoice_group": default_invoice_group,
        "default_invoice_terms": default_terms,
        "invoice_default_payment_method": default_payment_method,
        "invoices_due_after": invoices_due_after,
        "generate_invoice_number_for_draft": generate_invoice_number_draft == "true",
        "enable_pdf_watermarks": enable_pdf_watermarks == "true",
        "invoice_pdf_password": invoice_pdf_password,
        "include_zugferd": include_zugferd == "true",
        "pdf_template": default_pdf_template
    }
    # Save or update settings in DB
    settings_obj = db.query(InvoiceSettings).first()
    if not settings_obj:
        settings_obj = InvoiceSettings(**settings)
        db.add(settings_obj)
    else:
        for key, value in settings.items():
            setattr(settings_obj, key, value)
    db.commit()
    return templates.TemplateResponse("settings/invoice.html", {
        "request": request,
        "user": current_user,
        "invoice_settings": settings_obj,
        "success_message": "Settings saved successfully."
    })
```

### Step 2: Ensure Model Supports All Fields

Check `app/models/invoicesettings.py` for all required fields and types. Update if needed to match the form and schema.

### Step 3: Update Success Message (Optional)

In `app/templates/settings/invoice.html`, update the success message to confirm persistence:

```html
{% if success_message %}
<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    {{ success_message }}
    <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

## 3. Testing

- Submit the form and verify that settings are saved in the `invoice_settings` table.
- Reload the page and confirm settings are loaded from the database.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update `app/routers/settings.py` to persist invoice settings in the database
- [ ] Ensure all required fields are present in `app/models/invoicesettings.py`
- [ ] Confirm form field names in `app/templates/settings/invoice.html` match backend keys
- [ ] Update success message in `app/templates/settings/invoice.html` to confirm persistence
- [ ] Test form submission and verify data is saved in `invoice_settings` table
- [ ] Test loading and displaying settings from the database
- [ ] Remove any remaining TODO comments related to invoice settings persistence
- [ ] Document any additional changes or edge cases

---

**Summary:**
- Edit `settings.py` to persist settings.
- Ensure model and template support all fields.
- Test saving and loading functionality.

# GitHub Copilot Investigation Instructions: SQLAlchemy Rollback Issue

## Context
We have a SQLAlchemy database operation sequence that shows a successful UPDATE followed by a failed transaction containing a SELECT operation that ends in ROLLBACK. The logs show:

```
2025-07-21 05:49:22,547 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine COMMIT
2025-07-21 05:49:22,549 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine BEGIN (implicit)
2025-07-21 05:49:22,550 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine SELECT invoice_settings.id, invoice_settings.default_invoice_group, [...]
2025-07-21 05:49:22,550 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine ROLLBACK
```

## Investigation Tasks

### 1. Code Analysis
Please analyze the codebase and identify:

- **Transaction Boundaries**: Locate where database sessions/transactions are created, committed, and rolled back
- **Invoice Settings Operations**: Find all code that interacts with the `invoice_settings` table, particularly:
  - UPDATE operations for `default_invoice_terms` and `pdf_invoice_footer`
  - SELECT operations that fetch invoice settings by ID
- **Error Handling**: Identify existing exception handling around database operations
- **Session Management**: Determine how SQLAlchemy sessions are managed (scoped sessions, context managers, manual management)

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
Investigate these potential causes:

#### A. Exception Handling Issues
- Look for unhandled exceptions between the SELECT query and expected commit
- Check for missing try/except blocks around database operations
- Identify any validation logic that might fail after the SELECT

#### B. Transaction Scope Problems
- Verify transaction boundaries are properly defined
- Look for nested transactions or improper session usage
- Check if autocommit settings are interfering

#### C. Connection/Threading Issues
- Examine if multiple threads are accessing the same session
- Look for connection pool exhaustion or timeout issues
- Check for proper session cleanup

#### D. Application Logic Errors
- Find any business logic that executes after the SELECT query
- Look for validation failures, permission checks, or data processing errors
- Identify any operations that might trigger a rollback

### 3. Code Locations to Examine
Focus your investigation on:

```python
# Look for patterns like:
- session.query(InvoiceSettings).filter_by(id=1).first()
- session.commit() / session.rollback()
- update operations on invoice_settings table
- exception handling around database operations
- session lifecycle management
```

### 4. Generate Investigation Report
Create a report with the following sections:

#### A. Summary
- Brief description of the issue
- Timeline of events from the logs
- Impact assessment

#### B. Code Analysis Results
- Location of relevant database operations
- Current transaction management approach
- Identified patterns or anti-patterns

#### C. Root Cause Assessment
- Primary suspected cause(s)
- Supporting evidence from code analysis
- Risk factors that contributed to the issue

#### D. Recommendations
- Immediate fixes to prevent the rollback
- Long-term improvements for better error handling
- Code patterns to implement

#### E. Code Examples
- Show the problematic code (if identified)
- Provide corrected code examples
- Include proper error handling patterns

### 5. Specific Code Patterns to Look For

```python
# Problematic patterns:
session.begin()
# ... operations ...
# Missing commit or improper error handling

# Look for missing error handling:
try:
    result = session.query(InvoiceSettings).get(1)
    # Some operation that might fail
except:
    # Missing rollback handling

# Check for session management issues:
# Multiple sessions or improper cleanup
```

### 6. Questions to Answer
- What code executes between the SELECT query and the ROLLBACK?
- Are there any validation rules or business logic that might fail?
- Is the session being properly managed throughout the operation?
- Are there any concurrent operations that might interfere?
- What error messages or exceptions are being suppressed?

## Output Format
Please provide your findings in a structured report format with:
1. Executive summary
2. Technical analysis
3. Root cause determination
4. Recommended fixes with code examples
5. Prevention strategies

## Additional Context
- This appears to be an invoice management system
- The failed operation involves reading invoice settings after a successful update
- The issue seems to be in the application layer rather than database constraints

# SQLAlchemy Rollback Issue: Structured Investigation & Root Cause Analysis (21 Jul 2025)

## 1. Executive Summary

A SQLAlchemy transaction involving the `invoice_settings` table shows a successful `COMMIT` after an update, followed by a `SELECT` and an immediate `ROLLBACK`. This suggests an error occurred during or after the SELECT operation, causing the transaction to abort. The issue appears to be in the application layer, not the database schema.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### Transaction Boundaries
- Sessions are managed via FastAPI dependency injection (`db: Session = Depends(get_db)`).
- Transactions are implicitly started and committed/rolled back by SQLAlchemy when using the session.
- The POST handler for invoice settings (`save_invoice_settings`) performs an update, then commits and refreshes the object.

### Invoice Settings Operations
- **Update:** The handler updates fields like `default_invoice_terms` and `pdf_invoice_footer` in the `InvoiceSettings` model.
- **Select:** After commit, the handler refreshes the object, which triggers a SELECT.
- **Error Handling:** There is no explicit try/except around the database operations in the handler.

### Session Management
- Session is provided by FastAPI dependency, likely using a scoped session or context manager.
- No manual session cleanup or rollback is present in the handler.

## 3. Root Cause Determination

### Primary Suspected Cause
- **Unhandled Exception:** If an error occurs during the refresh (SELECT) or while rendering the template (e.g., accessing a missing attribute), SQLAlchemy will roll back the transaction.
- **Data Mismatch:** If the model or template expects a field that is missing or misnamed, an AttributeError or similar exception may be raised.
- **Boolean/String Conversion:** Some fields (e.g., `generate_invoice_number_for_draft`, `enable_pdf_watermarks`) are set using string comparison (`== "on"` or `"true"`), which may not match the form values, causing unexpected data or validation errors.

### Supporting Evidence
- The logs show a successful COMMIT, then a BEGIN and SELECT, followed by a ROLLBACK—typical of an exception during object refresh or template rendering.
- No explicit error handling is present, so any exception will propagate and trigger a rollback.

### Risk Factors
- Lack of try/except blocks around DB operations.
- Potential mismatch between form field names, backend parameters, and model attributes.
- Implicit session management may hide transaction boundaries.

## 4. Recommended Fixes with Code Examples

### Immediate Fixes
- Add explicit error handling around database operations:

```python
try:
    # ...existing code for update and commit...
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(settings_obj)
except Exception as e:
    db.rollback()
    # Optionally log the error
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

- Ensure all form field names, backend parameters, and model attributes match exactly.
- Validate and convert form values properly (e.g., use `"on"` or `"true"` consistently).

### Long-Term Improvements
- Use Pydantic models for validation before saving to the database.
- Add logging for exceptions to aid future debugging.
- Ensure session cleanup and rollback on all errors.

### Example Error Handling Pattern

```python
@router.post("/invoice", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def save_invoice_settings(...):
    try:
        # ...existing DB logic...
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(settings_obj)
        return templates.TemplateResponse("settings/invoice.html", {...})
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()
        # Log error, show user-friendly message
        return templates.TemplateResponse("settings/invoice.html", {
            "request": request,
            "user": current_user,
            "invoice_settings": settings_obj,
            "error_message": f"Failed to save settings: {e}",
            "title": "Invoice Settings"
        })
```

## 5. Prevention Strategies

- Always wrap database operations in try/except blocks.
- Validate incoming form data before saving.
- Ensure all field names and types are consistent across the template, backend, and model.
- Log all exceptions and rollbacks for future analysis.
- Regularly test form submission and error scenarios.

## 6. Answers to Key Questions

- **What code executes between the SELECT and ROLLBACK?** Likely a template render or object refresh, which may access a missing or misnamed attribute.
- **Any validation or business logic failures?** Possible if form values are not converted correctly or fields are missing.
- **Is the session managed properly?** Session is managed by FastAPI, but lacks explicit error handling.
- **Concurrent operations?** Unlikely, unless multiple requests use the same session.
- **Suppressed error messages?** Without logging, exceptions may be hidden.

Perfect! Now I can see the actual code causing the rollback issue. Looking at the `save_invoice_settings` function, I've identified the **exact problem**:

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in the `save_invoice_settings` POST handler. Here's what's happening:

1. **Successful UPDATE and COMMIT** - The database operations complete successfully
2. **SELECT (via refresh)** - `db.refresh(settings_obj)` triggers the SELECT query
3. **ROLLBACK** - An exception occurs somewhere after the refresh, causing the rollback

## The Specific Problems

### 1. **Missing Exception Handling**
The entire function lacks try/except blocks, so any error after `db.commit()` will cause an automatic rollback.

### 2. **Potential Template Context Issues**
The function passes `settings_obj` to the template, but if there are any issues with the object state or template rendering, it will cause an exception.

### 3. **Form Parameter Mismatch**
There's a mismatch between the form parameter name and the variable name:
- Form parameter: `generate_invoice_number_draft`  
- But it's used to set: `generate_invoice_number_for_draft`

## Immediate Fix

Here's the corrected version of your `save_invoice_settings` function:## Additional Debugging Steps

To identify the exact failure point, add this enhanced logging version temporarily:## Key Issues to Check

1. **Template File**: Ensure `settings/invoice.html` exists and doesn't reference any undefined variables
2. **Form Field Names**: Verify your HTML form uses the exact parameter names defined in the function
3. **Model Attributes**: Check that all attributes being set on `InvoiceSettings` actually exist in the model
4. **Database Connection**: Ensure the database session is still valid during the refresh operation

## Next Steps

1. **Replace** your current `save_invoice_settings` function with the fixed version above
2. **Run the application** and try to save invoice settings
3. **Check the logs** to see exactly where the failure occurs
4. **Share the error message** you get from the logs so we can pinpoint the exact issue

The logging version will tell us exactly at which step the failure happens, making it much easier to fix the root cause.
